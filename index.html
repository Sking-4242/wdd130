        <p>
            I am a student at BYUI, I am currently studying to be a cloud engineer so I can control the weather.
        <p>
            I tend to not have a lot of free time but when I do I enjoy being outdoors backpacking and away from civilization.
        </p>
            I am married and have a daughter. She is undeniably the cutest baby in the world. She also enjoys being outdoors and is already a better hiker than I am.
